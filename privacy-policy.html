        uses, and shares information when you use our mobile game, <strong>MegaSim</strong> (the "Game").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1. Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <p>When you play MegaSim, we or our third-party partners automatically collect certain information about your device
        and how you interact with the Game. This helps us display relevant ads and understand how the Game is used. This
        information includes:</p>

        <li><strong>Device identifiers:</strong> Such as your Android Advertising ID (AAID or GAID).</li>
        <li><strong>Device information:</strong> Device model, operating system version, mobile network information, and

        <li><strong>IP address:</strong> Used to approximate your general location and for fraud prevention.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> Information about your interactions with the Game, like the duration of your
            sessions, the ads you view and click on, and crash reports.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>
    <p>Our third-party advertising partner, Google AdMob, may use cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking
        technologies. These technologies collect information about your device and your activity within MegaSim and
        across other apps and websites. This data helps AdMob deliver targeted advertisements and measure their
        effectiveness.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <li>To comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms of service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With Advertising Partners:</strong> We share device and usage information (like your Android
            Advertising ID and IP address) with our third-party advertising partner, <strong>Google AdMob</strong>.
            AdMob uses this information to:
            <ul>

                <li>Measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.</li>
                <li>Perform ad reporting and analytics.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>For more information on how Google AdMob collects and processes data, please refer to Google's
                    Privacy Policy at: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy"
                        target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a> and Google's policies for AdMob at: <a
                        href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543"
                        target="_blank">https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543</a></strong>.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if required by law or in response to
            valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency).</li>
        <li><strong>To Protect Our Rights:</strong> We may disclose your information when we believe it's necessary to
            investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our terms of service, or to protect
            the rights, property, or safety of <strong>William Shoiti Saito LTDA</strong>, our users, or others.</li>
        <li><strong>In Connection with Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition,
            reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred
            as part of that transaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Aggregated or Anonymized Data:</strong> We may share aggregated or anonymized information that
            cannot reasonably be used to identify you, with third parties for various purposes, including analytics and
            marketing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain the information we collect for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy
        Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. AdMob's data retention policies are
        governed by Google's Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Opt-Out of Personalized Advertising:</strong> You can generally limit personalized advertising by
            adjusting the privacy settings on your Android device:
            <ul>
                <li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Google</strong> &gt; <strong>Ads</strong>.</li>
                <li>Tap <strong>"Reset advertising ID"</strong> to get a new identifier.</li>
                <li>Tap <strong>"Delete advertising ID"</strong> to remove it completely.</li>
                <li>You can also enable <strong>"Opt out of Ads Personalization."</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>These actions may limit the ability of AdMob and other ad networks to serve personalized ads, but you may
                still see generic ads.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Other Rights:</strong> Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., if you are in the European Economic
            Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or Brazil), you may have the right to access, correct, or request the
            deletion of your personal information. Please contact us using the information below to inquire about
            exercising these rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>MegaSim is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information
        directly from children under 13. While AdMob may show ads, you are responsible for correctly setting your target
        audience in the Google Play Console, which influences AdMob's behavior regarding child-directed apps. If you are
        a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information (beyond what AdMob
        might incidentally collect as part of its general ad serving), please contact us, and we will take steps to
        delete such information from our systems.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the information we collect
        from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no method of
        transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information, including data collected by AdMob, may be stored and processed in any country where we or
        Google (AdMob's operator) have facilities or where we engage service providers. By using MegaSim, you understand
        that your information may be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence, which may have
        different data protection laws than your country. As you are located in Brazil, and your users may be in the
        European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or other regions, we and Google take appropriate measures to
        ensure that your data is handled in accordance with GDPR, UK GDPR, and LGPD respectively, when transferred
        outside these regions, such as by using standard contractual clauses.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy
        Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy
        periodically for any changes. Your continued use of MegaSim after any modifications to this Privacy Policy will
        constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified
        Privacy Policy.</p>
